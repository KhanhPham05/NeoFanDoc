# Setup JDK

In order to start, we need to set a few things up. Firstly, we need a Java Development Kit.

## Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)
Different from Java Runtime Environment, which is for most Minecraft players; JDK is used for developers.

It is recommended to install JDK from [Here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

Choose the correct Operating System that your computer is running, and the package type should be **JDK**, <s>not JRE</s>, finally the Version **has to be 17-LTS** as Minecraft mods should be written with that Java version.

!!! note
    For convenience, you may consider install the `.msi` package of the JDK, and adding the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is also a should.
