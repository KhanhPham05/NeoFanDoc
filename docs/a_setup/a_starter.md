# Set up the development environment

In order to start developing your first mod, we need to set up the development environment.

## What is needed ?

1. Good knowledge into the [Java programing language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29).
2. Recommendation : your PC should satisfy the minimum requirements for IntelliJ IDEA, [see here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/prerequisites.html#min_requirements).
3. A reasonable internet speed for your mod set-up.
